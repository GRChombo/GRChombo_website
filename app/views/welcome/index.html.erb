    <p>GRChombo is a new open-source code for numerical general relativity simulations. It is developed and maintained by a collaboration of numerical relativists with a wide range of research interests, from early universe cosmology to astrophysics and mathematical general relativity, and has been used in many papers since its first release in 2015.
    </p>
    <p>GRChombo is written entirely in C++14, using hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelism and vector intrinsics to achieve good performance on the latest architectures. Furthermore, it makes use of the Chombo library for adaptive mesh refinement to allow automatic increasing and decreasing of the grid resolution in regions of arbitrary shape and topology.
